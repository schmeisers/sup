# Sup

A console-based email client with the best features of GMail, mutt and
Emacs.

## Installation

[See the wiki][Installation]

## Features / Problems

Features:

* GMail-like thread-centered archiving, tagging and muting
* [Handling mail from multiple mbox and Maildir sources][sources]
* Blazing fast full-text search with a [rich query language][search]
* Multiple accounts - pick the right one when sending mail
* [Ruby-programmable hooks][hooks]
* Automatically tracking recent contacts

Current limitations:

* Sup does in general not play nicely with other mail clients, not all
  changes can be synced back to the mail source. Refer to [Maildir Syncback][maildir-syncback]
  in the wiki for this recently included feature. Maildir Syncback
  allows you to sync back flag changes in messages and to write messages
  to maildir sources.

* Unix-centrism in MIME attachment handling and in sendmail invocation.

## Problems

Please report bugs to the [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/sup-heliotrope/sup/issues).
